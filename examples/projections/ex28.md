# Mixing UTM and geographic axes annotations

This is a question that comes up regularly such that GMT has a gallery example (famous
[example 28](https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/dev/gallery/ex28.html#example-28)) to show how to do it.
But even with that example it's not a trivial thing to do.

However it's trivial from the Julia wrapper under the condition that the grid or image to be displayed is
referenced internally. If it is not, `grdedit` can be used to assign a referencing system via its option `proj`.
The other condition is that grid or image to be displayed is already in memory (so that the internal
magicks can work). Given that, [example 28](https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/dev/gallery/ex28.html#example-28)
boils down to this (with a little bit less fancy details).


\begin{examplefig}{}
```julia
using GMT
G = gmtread("@Kilauea.utm.nc");
C = makecpt(cmap="copper", range=(0,1500));
imshow(G, cmap=C, shade=true, frame=(axes="WS", annot=true),
	coast=(shore=true, ocean=:lightblue, frame=(axes="EN", annot=true, grid=true)))
```
\end{examplefig}

The above example, however, relied in having a UTM-referenced grid file already available.
If you want to do the same with a global grid such as `@earth_relief_03s`, you can request a region in UTM
coordinates and ask to project the fetched grid.
This can be done on-the-fly by using the `region`, `proj` and the `convert=true` options in `gmtread`, like so:

\begin{examplefig}{}
```julia
using GMT
G = gmtread("@earth_relief_03s", region=[420000, 470000, 4510000, 4535000],
            proj="+proj=utm +zone=33", convert=true);
imshow(G, shade=true, frame=(axes="WS", annot=true),
	coast=(shore=true, ocean=:lightblue, frame=(axes="EN", annot=true, grid=true)))
```
\end{examplefig}
