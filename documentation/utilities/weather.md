# weather

```julia
[D =] weather(lon=0.0, lat=0.0; city::String="", last=0, days=7, year::Int=0, starttime::Union{DateTime, String}="",
              endtime::Union{DateTime, String}="", variable="temperature_2m", debug=false, show=false, kw...)
```

Plot and/or retrieve weather data obtained from the [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs) API.
Please consult the site for further details. You will find that there are many variables available to plot
and with not so obvious names. There are also *forecast* and *archive* versions of the variables. This
function tries to guess that from the variable names. That list of variable names is a bit extensive
and we are not reproducing it entirely here, but given it interest for climatological reason, we do list
the so called $daily$ variables.

- `variable`: "temperature_2m_max", "temperature_2m_min", "apparent_temperature_max", "apparent_temperature_min",
"precipitation_sum", "rain_sum", "snowfall_sum", "precipitation_hours", "sunshine_duration", "daylight_duration",
"wind_speed_10m_max", "wind_gusts_10m_max", "wind_direction_10m_dominant", "shortwave_radiation_sum",
"et0_fao_evapotranspiration"

A word of aknowledge is also due to the [WeatherReport.jl](https://github.com/vnegi10/WeatherReport.jl) project
that inspired this function, that is much smaller (~25 LOC) and has no further dependencies than GMT itself.

- `lon` and `lat`: Explicitly provide the coordinates of the location. If not provided, nor the `city` name,
  the current location is used from an IP location service (see the `whereami` function help).

- `city`: The name of the location that will be used. City names are normally OK but if it fails see the help of the
  `geocoder()` function as that is what is used to transform names to coordinates. The default is to use the current
  geographic location of the user.

- `days`: When asking for forecasts this is the number of days to forecast. Maximum is 16 days. Default is 7.

- `starttime`: Limit to events on or after the specified start time. NOTE: All times use ISO8601 Date/Time format
  OR a DateTime type. Default is NOW - 30 days.

- `endtime`: Limit to events on or before the specified end time. Same remarks as for `starttime`. Default is present time.

- `last`: If value is an integer (*e.g.* `last=90`), select the events in the last n days. If it is a string 
  than we expect that it ends with a 'w'(eek), 'm'(onth) or 'y'(ear). Example: `last="2Y"` (period code is caseless)

- `year`: An integer, restrict data download to this year.

- `debug`: Print the url of the requested data and return.

- `data`: The default is to make a seismicity map but if the `data` option is used (containing whatever)
  we return the data in a ``GMTdataset``

- `figname`: **savefig** | **figname** | **name** :: [Type => Str]

  Save the figure with the `figname=name.ext` where `ext` chooses the figure format (e.g. figname="name.png")

- `show`: By default this function just returns the data in a `GMTdataset` but if `show=true` it shows the plot.
  Use `data=true` to also return the data even when `show=true`.

### Examples

```julia
# Plot the temperature forecast of your location. Also returns the data table.
D = weather(data=true, show=true)
```

Plot the rain fall during 2023 at Copenhagen

\begin{examplefig}{}
```julia
using GMT
weather(city="Copenhagen", year=2023, variable="rain_sum", show=true)
```
\end{examplefig}
