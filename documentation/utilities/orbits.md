# orbits

```julia
orbits(xyz::Matrix{<:Real}; first=true, radius=6371.007, height=0, lon0=0, lat0=0, show=false, kw...)
```

Plots the orbit, or whatever the input data in `xyz` represents, about the Earth or other planetary bodies.

- `xyz`: The orbit coordinates. By default, we expect the coordinates in the Earth Centered Earth Fixed (ECEF)
  system but they can be in spherical coordinates (lon, lat) as well. In this case `xyz` must be a Mx2 matrix
  and `height` (the orbit height) must be > 0. If this argument is omitted, we plot a demo spiral "orbit".

- `radius`: The planetary body (spherical) radius. This value may be passed in meters or km and is only used
  when input is passed in spherical coordinates.

- `first`: Boolean that indicates if ``orbits`` creates the first layer of the image plot. If the default
  value of `true` is used, we also make a call to ``coast`` to plot the Earth using an Orthographic projection.
  The default option for this is plot the coastlines only, bur other options, *e.g.* colorizing the continents,
  are also available via the `kw...` arguments. Setting `first=false`, or better, use the ``orbits!`` form,
  skips the ``coast`` call, which lets this plot be appended to a previous plot as for example the one produced
  by \myreflink{grdimage} on a Eart's DEM. Note, however, that in this case the previous plot must have used the same
  `lon0` and `lat0` otherwise the visible orbit will be wrong. 

- `lon0`: Central longitude of the Orthographic projection.

- `lat0`:  Central latitude of the Orthographic projection.

- `height`: Used when input `xyz` is a Mx2 (lon, lat) matrix and represents the height in *meters* above
  the sphere of radius `radius`. (MUST be > 0 and not 'too small' or this function's algorithm fails.) 

- `show`: Set this to `true` if want to see the produced image. Leaving it as `false` permits adding more
  elements by posterior plotting calls.

- `kw`: keyword arguments to be consumed in the \myreflink{coast} and \myreflink{plot3} calls. For example, `land=:tomato,
  lw=1, lc=:blue` paints the continent with the `tomato` color and plots the orbits with blue, 1pt thick lines.
