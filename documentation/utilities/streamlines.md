# streamlines

```julia
S = streamlines(U::GMTgrid, V::GMTgrid, startX, startY; step=0.1, max_vert::Int=10000)
```

Compute 2-D streamlines as a 2-D matrix (in fact, a \myreflink{GMTdataset}) of vector fields.
The inputs `U` and `V` are \myreflink{GMTgrid}s with the `x` and `y` velocity components, and `startX` and
`startY` are the starting positions of the streamlines. `step` is the step size in data units for
interpolating the vector data and `max_vert` is the maximum number of vertices in a streamline.
`startX` and `startY` can both be scalars, vectors or one a scalar and the other a vector.
Returns a Vector{GMTdataset} with the streamlines.

```julia
S = streamlines(U::GMTgrid, V::GMTgrid, D::GMTdataset; step=0.1, max_vert::Int=10000)
```

In this method the streamlines starting positions are fetch from the 2 columns of the `D` argument.
Returns a Vector{GMTdataset} with the streamlines.

```julia
S, A = streamlines(U::GMTgrid, V::GMTgrid; step=0.1, max_vert::Int=10000)
```

Method that computes automatically spaced streamlines from 2D grids U and V. Returns the streamlines
in the `S` Vector{GMTdataset} and `A` holds the positions along the streamlines where to plot
arrow-heads if wished.

```julia
S = streamlines(U::GMTgrid, V::GMTgrid; side::Union{String, Symbol}="left", step=0.1, max_vert::Int=10000)
```

Here we auto-generate the starting positions along one of the 4 sides of the grid. Select the wished side
with the `side` keyword. Returns a Vector{GMTdataset} with the streamlines.

```julia
S = streamlines(x, y, U::Matrix, V::Matrix, sx, sy; step=0.1, max_vert::Int=10000)
```

This last 2D method let users pass the `x` and `y` vector data coordinates, U and V are matrices with the
velocity data and the remaining arguments have the same meaning as in the other methods. Returns a
Vector{GMTdataset} with the streamlines.

```julia
S = streamlines(x::Matrix, y::Matrix, U::Matrix, V::Matrix; step=0.1, max_vert::Int=10000)
```

`x` and `y` are assumed to be meshgrids with the *x* and *y* starting coordinates.

```julia
S = streamlines(U::GMTgrid, V::GMTgrid, W::GMTgrid, startX, startY, startZ; step=0.1, max_vert::Int=10000)
```

Conpute 3D volume of vector fields with streamline. Here `U`,`V` and `W` are 3D cubes with `x,y,z`
velocity components. `startX`, `startY` and `startZ` can be scalar or vector coordinate arrays.
Returns a Vector{GMTdataset} with the streamlines.

Examples
--------

\begin{examplefig}{}
```julia
using GMT

x,y = GMT.meshgrid(-10:10);
u = 2 .* x .* y;
v = y .^2 - x .^ 2;
U = mat2grid(u, x[1,:], y[:,1]);
V = mat2grid(v, x[1,:], y[:,1]);
r,a = streamlines(U, V);
plot(r, decorated=(locations=a, symbol=(custom="arrow", size=0.3), fill=:black, dec2=true), show=1)
```
\end{examplefig}
