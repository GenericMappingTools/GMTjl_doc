Spectral calculations of gravity, isostasy, admittance, and coherence for grids.

Synopsis
--------

Description
-----------

**gravfft** can be used into three main modes;

- Mode 1: Simply compute the geopotential due to the surface given in the topo.grd file.
Requires a density contrast (**density**) and possibly a different observation level(**level**).
It will take the 2-D forward FFT of the grid and use the full Parker's method up to the chosen terms.

- Mode 2: Compute the geopotential response due to flexure of the topography file. It will take the 2-D
forward FFT of the grid and use the  full Parker's method applied to the chosen isostatic model.
The available models are the "loading from top", or elastic plate model, and the "loading from below"
which accounts for the plate's response to a sub-surface load (appropriate for hot spot modeling).
In both cases, the model parameters are set with **topo_load** and **moho_depth** options.

- Mode 3: compute the admittance or coherence between two grids. The output is the average in the
radial direction. Optionally, the model admittance may also be calculated.  Given the number of
choices this program offers, is difficult to state what are options and what are required arguments.
It depends on what you are doing; see the examples for further guidance.

Required Argument
-----------------

One or two 2-D gridded data sets to be processed.

Optional Arguments
------------------

- **C** or **tadmitt** : -- *tadmitt=(n=?,wavelength=?,mean_depth=?, from_top=true, from_below=true, wavelengths=true)*\
    Compute only the theoretical admittance curves of the selected model and exit. *n* and *wavelength*
    are used to compute (n * wavelength) the total profile length in meters. *mean_depth* is the mean
    water depth. Append information if model is `from_top` or `from_below` and optionally `wavelengths=true`
    to write wavelength instead of frequency.

- **D** or **density** : -- *density=?* **|** *density=rhogrid*\
    Sets density contrast across surface. Used, for example, to compute the gravity attraction of the
    water layer that can later be combined with the free-air anomaly to get the Bouguer anomaly.
    In this case do not use **topo_load**. It also implicitly sets **dimentions="+h"**.  Alternatively, specify
    a co-registered grid, *rhogrid*, either in the form of a file name or a GMTgrid objec, with density
    contrasts if a variable density contrast is required. **Note**: Any NaNs found in the density grid
    will be replaced with the minimum density found.

- **E** or **nterms** : -- *nterms=n*\
    Number of terms used in Parker expansion (limit is 10, otherwise
    terms depending on n will blow out the program) [Default = 3].

- **F** or **field** : -- *field=(faa=true, slab=true, far_field=true, bouguer=true, geoid=true, vgg=true, east=true, north=true)*\
    Specify desired geopotential field: compute geoid rather than gravity
    - **faa** = Free-air anomalies (mGal) [Default]. Add **slab=true** to add in the slab
       implied when removing the mean value from the topography.  This requires zero topography
       to mean no mass anomaly. Alternatively, to force the far-field to be exactly zero
       (i.e., the corner nodes of the grid), select **far_field=true** instead.
    - **bouguer** = Bouguer gravity anomalies (mGal).
    - **geoid** = Geoid anomalies (m).
    - **vgg** = Vertical Gravity Gradient (VGG; 1 Eotvos = 0.1 mGal/km).
    - **east** = East deflections of the vertical (micro-radian).
    - **north** = North deflections of the vertical (micro-radian).

\textinput{common_opts/opt_save_grd}

- **I** or **admitt** : -- *admitt=(wavelengths=true, km=true, coherence=true, tadmitt=true, elastic=true)*\
    Use *ingrid2* and *ingrid1* (a grid with topography/bathymetry) to estimate admittance or
    coherence and rturn it in a \myreflink{GMTdataset} (**outgrid** ignored if set). This grid
    should contain gravity or geoid for the same region of *ingrid1*. Default computes admittance.
    Output contains 3 or 4 columns. Frequency (wavelength), admittance (coherence) one sigma
    error bar and, optionally, a theoretical admittance. Use one to three from: `wavelengths, km,
    tadmitt, coherence, elastic`, **wavelengths** writes wavelength instead of wavenumber, **km**
    selects km for wavelength unit [m], **coherence** computes coherence instead of admittance,
    **tadmitt** writes a fourth column with "loading from below" theoretical admittance, and
    **elastic** writes a fourth column with "elastic plate" theoretical admittance.

\textinput{common_opts/explain_fft}

- **Q** or **flex_topo** : -- *flex_topo=true*\
    Return/saves out a grid with the flexural topography (with z positive up) whose average depth was set
    by **moho_depth=zm** and model parameters by **topo_load**. That is the "gravimetric Moho".
    **flex_topo** implicitly sets **-N+h**.

- **S** or **:S :subplate** : -- *:S :subplate=true*\
    Computes predicted gravity or geoid grid due to a subplate load produced by the current bathymetry and
    the theoretical model. The necessary parameters are set within **topo_load** and **moho_depth** options.
    The number of powers in Parker expansion is restricted to 1. See an example further down.

- **T** or **topo_load** : -- *topo_load=(ethickness=?, rho_load=?, rho_mantle=?, rho_infill=?, moho=true)*\
    Compute the isostatic compensation from the topography load (input grid file) on
    an elastic plate of thickness **ethickness**. Also append densities for load, mantle,
    water and infill in SI units. If **rho_infill** is not provided it defaults to **rho_load**.
    Give average mantle depth via **moho_depth**. If the elastic thickness
    is > 1e10 it will be interpreted as the flexural rigidity (by default it is
    computed from *ethickness* and Young modulus). Optionally, **moho=true** to write a grid
    with the Moho's geopotential effect (see **geopotential**) from model selected by **topo_load**.
    If **ethickness** = 0 then the Airy response is returned. **moho=true** implicitly sets **-N+h**.

- **W** or **level** : -- *level=wd[k]*\
    Set the observation height relative to topography in meters [0]. Append **k** to indicate km.
    In this later case, the whole option must _ofc_ be a string.

- **Z** or **moho_depth** : -- *moho_depth=zm[/zl]*\
    Moho [and swell] average compensation depths (in meters positive down â€“ the depth). For the "load from
    top" model you only have to provide `zm`, but for the "loading from below" don't forget to supply also `zl`.

Grid Distance Units
-------------------

If the grid does not have meter as the horizontal unit, append **+u**\ *unit*
to the input file name to convert from the specified unit to meter. If your
grid is geographic, convert distances to meters by supplying **colinfo** instead.

Considerations
--------------

netCDF COARDS grids will automatically be recognized as geographic. For other grids
geographical grids were you want to convert degrees into meters, select **colinfo**.
If the data are close to either pole, you should consider projecting the grid file
onto a rectangular coordinate system using \myreflink{grdproject}.

Handling of Grids with NaNs
---------------------------

Since we cannot take FFTs of 2-D grids that contain NaNs, we perform simple substitutions.
If any of the input grids contain NaNs they will be replaced with zeros. In contrast, if **density**
passes a grid with density contrasts then we replace any NaNs with the minimum density in the grid.

Data Detrending
---------------

The default detrending mode follows Parker [1972] and removes the mid-value (**+h**).
Consult and use **inquire** to select other modes.

Plate Flexure
-------------

The FFT solution to elastic plate flexure requires the infill density to equal
the load density.  This is typically only true directly beneath the load; beyond the load
the infill tends to be lower-density sediments or even water (or air).  Wessel [2001]
proposed an approximation that allows for the specification of an infill density
different from the load density while still allowing for an FFT solution. Basically,
the plate flexure is solved for using the infill density as the effective load density but
the amplitudes are adjusted by a factor *A* = sqrt ((rm - ri)/(rm - rl)), which is
the theoretical difference in amplitude due to a point load using the two different
load densities.  The approximation is very good but breaks down for large
loads on weak plates, a fairy uncommon situation.

Examples
--------

\begin{examplefig}{}
```julia
using GMT, FFTW

G = grdcut("@earth_relief_02m", region=(-12.5,-10,35.5,37.5));
G2 = gravfft(G, density=1700, field=(faa=6, slab=4), f=:g);
imshow(G2, colorbar=true)
```
\end{examplefig}

Other hypothetic examples.

To compute the effect of the water layer above the bat.grd bathymetry using 2700 and 1035
for the densities of crust and water and returning the result on `Gwater` (computing up
to the fourth power of bathymetry in Parker expansion):

```julia
  Gwater = gravfft("bat.grd", density=1665, nterms=4);
```

Now subtract it from your free-air anomaly faa.grd and you will get the Bouguer anomaly.
You may wonder why we are subtracting and not adding.  After all the Bouguer anomaly
pretends to correct the mass deficiency presented by the water layer, so we should add
because water is less dense than the rocks below. The answer relies on the way gravity
effects are computed by the Parker's method and practical aspects of using the FFT.

```julia
  Gbouguer = Gfaa - Gwater;
```

Want an MBA anomaly? Well compute the crust mantle contribution and add it to the sea-bottom
anomaly. Assuming a 6 km thick crust of density 2700 and a mantle with 3300 density we could
repeat the command used to compute the water layer anomaly, using 600 (3300 - 2700) as the
density contrast. But we now have a problem because we need to know the mean Moho depth.
That is when the scale/offset that can be appended to the grid's name comes in hand. Notice
that we didn't need to do that before because mean water depth was computed directly from data
(notice also the negative sign of the offset due to the fact that *z* is positive up):

```julia
  Gmoho = gravfft("bat.grd=+o-6000", density=600);
```

Now, subtract it from the Bouguer to obtain the MBA anomaly. That is:

```julia
  Gmba = Gbouguer - Gmoho;
```

To compute the Moho gravity effect of an elastic plate bat.grd with Te = 7 km,
density of 2700, over a mantle of density 3300, at an average depth of 9 km

```julia
  Gelastic = gravfft("bat.grd", topo_load="7000/2700/3300/1035+m", moho_depth=9000);
```

If you add now the sea-bottom and Moho's effects, you will get the full gravity
response of your isostatic model. We will use here only the first term in Parker expansion.

```julia
  Gwater = gravfft("bat.grd", density=1665, nterms=1);
  Gelastic = gravfft("bat.grd", topo_load="7000/2700/3300/1035+m", moho_depth=9000, nterms=1);
  Gmodel = Gwater + Gelastic;
```

The same result can be obtained directly by the next command. However, PAY ATTENTION to
the following. I don't yet know if it's because of a bug or due to some limitation, but
the fact is that the following and the previous commands only give the same result if
**nterms=1** is used.  For higher powers of bathymetry in Parker expansion, only the
above example seams to give the correct result.

```julia
  Gmodel = gravfft("bat.grd", topo_load="7000/2700/3300/1035", moho_depth=9000, nterms=1);
```

And what would be the geoid anomaly produced by a load at 50 km depth, below a region whose
bathymetry is given by bat.grd, a Moho at 9 km depth and the same densities as before?

```julia
  Gswell_geoid = gravfft("topo.grd", topo_load=(7000,2700,3300,1035), field=:geoid,
                        moho_depth=(9000,50000), subplate=true, nterms=1);
```

To compute the admittance between the topo.grd bathymetry and faa.grd free-air anomaly grid
using the elastic plate model of a crust of 6 km mean thickness with 10 km effective elastic
thickness in a region of 3 km mean water depth:

```julia
Dadmitt = gravfft(Gtopo, Gfaa, admitt=:elastic, topo_load=(10000,2700,3300,1035), moho_depth=9000);
```

To compute the admittance between the topo.grd bathymetry and geoid.grd geoid grid with the
"loading from below" (LFB) model with the same as above and sub-surface load at 40 km, but
assuming now the grids are in geographic and we want wavelengths instead of frequency:

```julia
Dadmitt = gravfft(Gtopo, Ggeoid, admitt=(below=true,wavelengths=true),
                  topo_load=(10000,2700,3300,1035), moho_depth=(9000,40000), colinfo=:g);
```

To compute the gravity theoretical admittance of a LFB along a 2000 km long profile
using the same parameters as above

```julia
Dadmitt = gravfft(tadmitt="400/5000/3000/b", topo_load=(10000,2700,3300,1035), moho_depth=(9000,40000));
```
