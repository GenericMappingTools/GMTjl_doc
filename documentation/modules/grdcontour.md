# grdcontour

```julia
grdcontour(cmd0::String="", arg1=nothing; kwargs...)
```

Make contour plot or map (using a projection) from a grid.

Read a 2-D grid and produces a contour plot by tracing each contour through the grid. Various options
that affect the plotting are available. Alternatively, the *x, y, z* positions of the contour lines may be
saved to one or more output files (or memory) and no plot is produced.

Required Arguments
------------------

The 2-D gridded data set to be contoured.

Optional Arguments
------------------

- **A** or **annot** or **annotation** : -- *annot=annot\_int* **|** *annot=(int=annot\_int, disable=true, single=true, labels=labelinfo)*\
  *annot\_int* is annotation interval in data units; it is ignored if contour levels are given in a file.
  [Default is no annotations]. Use *annot=(disable=true,)* to disable all annotations implied by **cont**.
  Alternatively do *annot=(single=true, int=val)* to plot *val* as a single contour. The optional *labelinfo* controls the specifics of the label formatting and consists of a named tuple with the following control arguments \myreflink{Label formatting}

- **D** or **dump** : -- *dump=fname*\
  Dump contours as data line segments; no plotting takes place. Append filename template which may contain
  C-format specifiers. If no filename template is given we write all lines to stdout. If filename has no
  specifiers then we write all lines to a single file. If a float format (e.g., %6.2f) is found we substitute
  the contour z-value. If an integer format (e.g., %06d) is found we substitute a running segment count. If
  an char format (%c) is found we substitute C or O for closed and open contours. The 1-3 specifiers may be
  combined and appear in any order to produce the the desired number of output files (e.g., just %c gives
  two files, just %f would separate segments into one file per contour level, and %d would write all segments
  to individual files; see manual page for more examples.

- **-F** or **force** : -- *force=true* **|** *force=:left* **|** *force=:right*\
  Force dumped contours to be oriented so that higher z-values are to the left (*force=:left*) or right
  (*force=:right*) as we move along the contour [Default is arbitrary orientation]. Requires **dump**.

- **G** or **labels** : -- *labels=()*\
  The required argument controls the placement of labels along the quoted lines. Choose among five
  controlling algorithms as explained in \myreflink{Placement methods}

\textinput{common_opts/opt_J}

- **L** or *range* : *-- range=(low,high)* **|** *range=:n|:p|:N|:P*\
  Limit range: Do not draw contours for data values below *low* or above *high*.  Alternatively,
  limit contours to negative (*range=:n*) or positive (*range=:p*) contours. Use upper case *N* or *P*
  to include the zero contour.

- **N** or **fill** : -- *fill=color*\
  Fill the area between contours using the discrete color table given by *color*, a \myreflink{Setting color} element.
  Then, **cont** and **annot** can be used as well to control the contour lines and annotations. If no *color*
  is set (*fill=[]*) then a discrete color setting must be given via **cont** instead.

- **Q** or **cut** : -- *cut=np* **|** *cut=length&unit[+z]*\
  Do not draw contours with less than *np* number of points [Draw all contours]. Alternatively, give
  instead a minimum contour length in distance units, including **c** (Cartesian distances using user
  coordinates) or **C** for plot length units in current plot units after projecting the coordinates.
  Optionally, append **+z** to exclude the zero contour.

\textinput{common_opts/opt_R}

- **S** or **smooth** : -- *smooth=smoothfactor*\
  Used to resample the contour lines at roughly every (*gridbox\_size/smoothfactor*) interval.

- **T** or **ticks** : -- *ticks=(local\_high=true, local\_low=true, gap=gap, closed=true, labels=labels)*\
  Will draw tick marks pointing in the downward direction every *gap* along the innermost closed contours only;
  set *closed=true* to tick all closed contours. Use *gap=(gap,length)* and optionally tick mark *length*
  (append units as **c**, **i**, or **p**) or use defaults [*"15p/3p"*]. User may choose to tick only local
  highs or local lows by specifying *local\_high=true*, *local\_low=true*, respectively. Set *labels* to
  annotate the centers of closed innermost contours (i.e., the local lows and highs). If no *labels* (*i.e*,
  set *labels=""*) is set, we use - and + as the labels. Appending exactly two characters, *e.g.*, *labels=:LH*,
  will plot the two characters (here, *L* and *H*) as labels. For more elaborate labels, separate the low and hight
  label strings with a comma (*e.g.*, *labels="lo,hi"*). If a file is given by **cont**, and **ticks** is set,
  then only contours marked with upper case C or A will have tick marks [and annotations]. Note: The labeling
  of local highs and lows may plot sometimes outside the innermost contour since only the mean value of the 
  ontour coordinates is used to position the label. 

- **W** or **pen** : -- *pen=(annot=true, contour=true, pen=pen, colored=true, cline=true, ctext=true)*\
  ``annot=true`` if present, means to annotate contours or ``contour=true`` for regular contours [Default].
  The *pen* sets the attributes for the particular line. Default pen for annotated contours: ``pen=(0.75,:black)``.
  Regular contours use ``pen=(0.25,:black)``. Normally, all contours are drawn with a fixed color determined by
  the pen setting. This option may be repeated, for example to separate contour and annotated contours settings.
  For that the syntax changes to use a Tuple of NamedTuples, *e.g.*  ``pen=((annot=true, contour=true, pen=pen), (annot=true, contour=true, pen=pen))``. If the modifier ``pen=(cline=true,)`` is used then the color of the contour lines are taken from the CPT (see **cont**). If instead ``pen=(ctext=true,)`` is appended then the color from the cpt file is applied to the contour annotations. Select ``pen=(colored=true,)`` for both effects.

- **Z** or **muladd** or **scale** : -- *scale=factor* **|** *muladd=(factor=factor, shift=shift, periodic=true)*\
  Use to subtract *shift* from the data and multiply the results by *factor* before contouring starts.
  (Numbers in **annot**, **cont**, **range** refer to values after this scaling has occurred.) Use ``periodic=true``
  to indicate that this grid file contains z-values that are periodic in 360 degrees (e.g., phase data, angular distributions) and that special precautions must be taken when determining 0-contours.

Examples
--------

Contour the *peaks* function. *cont=1* and *annot=2* means draw contours at every 1 unit of the *G*
grid and annotate at every other contour line:

\begin{examplefig}{}
```julia
using GMT
G = GMT.peaks();
grdcontour(G, cont=1, annot=2, show=true)
```
\end{examplefig}
