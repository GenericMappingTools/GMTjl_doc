# vband

```julia
vband(mat::Matrix; region=(...), width=false,  percent=false, fill=nothing, fillalpha=nothing)

hband(mat::Matrix; region=(...), height=false, percent=false, fill=nothing, fillalpha=nothing)
```

*keywords: GMT, Julia, plot*

Reads a MxN array where 2 <= N <= 4 and plot a vertical (`vband` or `vspan`) or horizontal (`hband` or `hspan`)
bands across the *xy* plot. If N == 2 the bands are plotted from *ymin* to *ymax* (`vband`) and from
*xmin* to *xmax* (`hband`). The optional 1 or 2 extra columns control the begin/end of each band (see examples).
The third (optional) column specifies the base of a vertical band or the left of the horizontal one. Use a NaN
to indicate that base|left = *y|x_min*. The 4rth column controls the top of vertical bands or the right of the horizontals.
Also here a NaN means top|right = *y|x_max*.

The bands *width* (or *height* in `hband`) are controlled by two alternative mechanisms. By default the input **mat**
array has rows with *x1 x2* (data) coordinates for the start and end of each `vband` and *y1 y2* for each `hband`.
But alternatively we may specify `width=true` (for `vbands`) or `percent=true` in which case the second column is
interpreted as the band *width* (or *height* in `hband`) or the percentage of the plot's width (height) in data
units.

A small annoyance in using these functions in a first call is that we **must** specify the plot limits. To minimize
this constrain, we can call them from with a `plot` call as a nested call (see example at the bottom). But even
here we have a lower order annoyance. When called nested in `plot` the bands will be plotted *over* the lines/symbols
and not *under* as it would be desirable. Mechanics of GMT make this difficult to achieve.

For syntax compatibility with other Julia plotting packages `vband` and `hband` have aliases `vspan` and `hspan`.

Parameters
----------

\textinput{common_opts/opt_B}

\textinput{common_opts/opt_J}

\textinput{common_opts/opt_R}

- **fill** or **color**\
   Select color or pattern for filling of symbols [Default is *lightblue*]. It can take the form of a string,
   a vector or a tuple of colors. See \myreflink{Setting color} for extend color selection (including color
   map generation). When more than one band is requested the bands colors are assigned
   by cycling through the colors given in this option. This means that a 3 bands and a `fill=[:red, :blue]` will plot
   first and third band in red and second in blue.

   Optionally the `fill` can be done with patterns (which includes the possibility of using images).

- **fillalpha** or **alpha** or **transparency** : -- *alpha=0.5* **|** *alpha=(50, 75)*\
   Control the transparency level. Numbers can be floats <= 1.0 or integers in 0-100 range. Default is 75.
   It can take the form of a number, a vector or a tuple of numbers.
   When more than one band is requested the bands transparencies are assigned by cycling through the values
   given in this option. This means that the number of bands and of transparencies may be different.

Examples
--------

A vertical bands with 2 colors and 3 transparencies

\begin{examplefig}{}
```julia
using GMT
vband([1 2; 2.5 3; 4 5], fill=(:red, :blue), alpha=(0.75, 0.5, 0.3), region=(0,5,-1,5), show=true)
```
\end{examplefig}

Now with variable heights.

\begin{examplefig}{}
```julia
using GMT
vband([1 2 0 NaN; 2.5 3 NaN 4; 4 5 1 3], fill=[:red, :blue], alpha=(0.75, 0.5, 0.3),
      region=(0,5,-1,5), show=true)
```
\end{examplefig}

A horizontal band plot with variable lengths and colors and constant transparency.

\begin{examplefig}{}
```julia
using GMT
hband([-0.5 0.5 0 3; 1 2 1 NaN; 3 4 NaN NaN], fill=(:red, :blue, :green), region=(0,5,-1,5), show=1)
```
\end{examplefig}

We can fill with patterns as well. And use an image as one of the patterns.

\begin{examplefig}{}
```julia
using GMT
vband([1 2; 2.5 4], fill=((pattern=TESTSDIR * "assets/tiling2.jpg", dpi=200), (pattern=27, dpi=200)),
      region=(0,5,-1,5), show=true)
```
\end{examplefig}

Do a nested call in which one is not forced to specify the plot limits but let it be computed from input data

\begin{examplefig}{}
```julia
using GMT
plot(0:0.5:5, rand(11), vband=(data=[1 2; 2.5 3; 4 4.2], fill=[:red, :blue, :green]), show=true)
```
\end{examplefig}
