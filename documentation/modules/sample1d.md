Resample 1-D table data using splines

Description
-----------

Reads a multi-column data set and interpolates the time-series or spatial profile at locations
where the user needs the values. The user must provide the column number of the independent (monotonically
increasing **or** decreasing) variable, here called *time* (it may of course be any type of quantity)
when that is not the first column in data set. Equidistant or arbitrary sampling can be selected.
All columns are resampled based on the new sampling interval. Several interpolation schemes are available,
in addition to a *smoothing* spline which trades off misfit for curvature. Extrapolation outside the range
of the input data is not supported.

Required Arguments
------------------

- *table*\
    One or more data tables containing the independent *time* variable (which must be monotonically
    in/de-creasing) and any number of optional columns holding other data values.

Optional Arguments
------------------

- **A** or **resample** : -- *resample="f|p|m|r|R"* **|** *resample="f|p|m|r|R[+d][+l]"*\
    For track resampling (if **inc**...*unit* is set) we can select how this is to be performed.
    Use **resample=:f** to keep original points, but add intermediate points if needed; note this
    selection does not necessarily yield equidistant points [Default]. **resample=:m** as **f**
    but first follow meridian (along y) then parallel (along x). **p** as **f** but first follow
    parallel (along y) then meridian (along x). **r** to resample at equidistant locations;
    input points are not necessarily included in the output. **R** as **r** but adjust given
    spacing to fit the track length exactly. Finally, append **+d** to delete duplicate input records
    (identified by having no change in the time column, and **+l** if distances should be measured
    along rhumb lines (loxodromes)). **Note**: Calculation made for loxodromes is spherical,
    hence **spherical=:ellipsoidal** cannot be used in combination with **+l**.

- **E** or **keeptext** : -- *keeptext=true*\
    If the input dataset contains records with trailing text then we will attempt to add these
    to output records that exactly match the input times. Output records that have no matching
    input record times will have no trailing text appended [Default ignores trailing text].
    Needs GMT6.4 or higher.

- **F** or **interp** : -- *interp=type* **|** *interp=(type, [,par], "derivative")*\
    The default is `Akima`. You may change the default interpolant; see `GMT_INTERPOLANT` in your `gmt.conf` file.

    Choose type from (the *interp_type=type* form):
    - **l**inear
    - **a**kima spline
    - **c**ubic (natural cubic spline)
    - **n**ointerp (no interpolation: nearest point)
    - **s**moothing cubic spline; append fit parameter *p*. Note, in this case one must pass only
      the first char, the **s** and the fitting parameter. Example: **interp="s0.01"**
    
    You may optionally evaluate the first or second derivative of the spline by appending **+d1** or **+d2**,
    respectively.
    
    When using the second form (the *interp_type=(...)*), the first member is the same as above, except the
    `smooth` and the derivatives. To select first or second derivative use the `:first` or `:second` keywords.
    Examples of this syntax: **interp=(:akima, :first)**, or **interp=(:smoothing, 0.1)**,
    or **interp=(:smoothing, 0.1, :second)**.

\begin{examplefig}{}
```julia
using GMT
mat = [0 0; 1 1; 2 1.5; 3 1.25; 4 1.5; 4.5 3; 5 2; 6 2.5];
gmtbegin()
    D = sample1d(mat, inc=0.01, interp=:cubic);
    plot(D, region=(-0.1,6.1,-0.1,3.1), figsize=(14,6), xlabel=:u, ylabel="u(x)", lw=1, legend="Cubic spline (F=:c)")
    D = sample1d(mat, inc=0.01, interp=(:smooth, 1));
    plot!(D, lw=1, lc=:orange, legend="Smooth cubic spline (F=:s1)")
    D = sample1d(mat, inc=0.01, interp=:linear);
    plot!(D, lw=1, lc=:blue, legend="Linear spline (F=:l)")
    D = sample1d(mat, inc=0.01, interp=:akima);
    plot!(D, lw=1, lc=:red, legend="Akima spline (F=:a)")
    D = sample1d(mat, inc=0.01, interp=:nointerp);
    plot!(D, lw=1, lc=:darkgreen, legend="Nearest neighbor (F=:n)")
    plot!(mat, marker=:circ, ms=0.25, mc=:red, ml=:thin, legend="Data")
    legend(position=(inside=:TL, width=4.9, offset=0.2), box=(pen=1, fill=:white, shaded=true))
gmtend(:show)
```
\end{examplefig}

   The **interp** option lets you choose among several interpolators, including
   one that is approximate (the smoothing spline). You can also specify
   that you actually need a derivative of the solution instead of the value.

- **N** or **time_col** or **timecol** : -- *timecol=t_col*\
    Sets the column number of the independent *time* variable [Default is 0 (first)].

- **T** or **range** or **inc** : -- *range=(min,max,inc[,:number,:log2,:log10])* **|** *range=[list]* **|** *range=file*\
    Make evenly spaced time-steps from *min* to *max* by *inc* [Default uses input times].
    The form **range=**_list_ means a online list of *time* coordinates like for example: `range=[13,15,16,22.5]`
    whilst `range=file` means: read the *time* coordinates from *file*, one coordinate per row in *file*.
    **Note**: For resampling of spatial (*x,y* or *lon,lat*) series you must give an increment with
    a valid distance unit; see \myreflink{Units} for map units or use **c** if plain Cartesian coordinates.
    The first two columns must contain the spatial coordinates. From these we calculate distances in the
    chosen units and interpolate using this parametric series.

- **cumdist** or **cumsum** : -- *cumdist=true*\
    Compute the cumulative distance along the input line. Note that for this the first two columns must
    contain the spatial coordinates and the accumulated distance is appended after last column of the table.

\textinput{common_opts/opt_V}

- **W** or **weights** : -- *weights=col*\
    Sets the column number of the weights to be used with a smoothing cubic spline. Requires **interp=:s**.

Notes
-----

The smoothing spline *s(t)* requires a fit parameter *p* that allows for the trade-off between an
exact interpolation (fitting the data exactly; large *p*) to minimizing curvature (*p* approaching 0).
Specifically, we seek to minimize

$$ F_p (s)= K (s) + p E (s), \quad p > 0 $$

where the misfit is evaluated as

    $$ E (s)= \sum^n_{i=1} \left [ \frac{s(t_i) - y_i}{\sigma_i} \right ]^2 $$

and the curvature is given by the integral over the domain of the second derivative of the spline

    $$ K (s) = \int ^b _a [s''(t) ]^2 dt. $$

Trial and error may be needed to select a suitable *p*.

Examples
--------

To resample the file profiles.tdgmb, which contains (time,distance,gravity,magnetics,bathymetry)
records, at 1 km equidistant intervals using Akima's spline, use:

```julia
    D = sample1d("profiles.tdgmb", timecol=1, interp=:akima, inc=1)
```

To resample the file depths.dt at positions listed in the file grav_pos.dg, using a cubic spline
for the interpolation, use:

```julia
    D = sample1d("depths.txt", range="grav_pos.dg", interp=:cubic)
```

To resample the file points.txt every 0.01 from 0-6, using a cubic spline for the
interpolation, but output the first derivative instead (the slope), try:

```julia
    Ds = sample1d("points.txt", range=(0,6,0.01), interp=(cubic, :first))
```

To resample the file track.txt which contains lon, lat, depth every 2 nautical miles, use:

```julia
    D = sample1d("track.txt", inc="2n", resample=:R)
```

To do approximately the same, but make sure the original points are included, use:

```julia
    D = sample1d("track.txt", inc="2n", resample=:f)
```

To obtain a rhumb line (loxodrome) sampled every 5 km instead, use:

```julia
    D = sample1d("track.txt", inc="5k", resample="R+l")
```

To sample temperatures.txt every month from 2000 to 2018, use

```julia
    Dmo = sample1d("temperatures.txt", range=("2000T", "2018T", "1o"))
```

To use a smoothing spline on a topographic profile for a given fit parameter, try:

```julia
    sample1d("@topo_crossection.txt", range(300,500,0.1), interp=(:smooth, 0.001)) 
```
