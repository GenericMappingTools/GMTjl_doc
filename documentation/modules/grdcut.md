# grdcut

```julia
    grdcut(cmd0::String="", arg1=[], kwargs...)
```

Extract subregion from a grid or image

Description
-----------

**grdcut** will produce a new *outgrid* which is a subregion of *ingrid*. The subregion may be specified
with **region** as in other programs; the specified range must not exceed the range of *ingrid*
(but see **extend**). If in doubt, run \myreflink{grdinfo} to check range. Alternatively, define the subregion
indirectly via a range check on the node values or via distances from a fixed point. Finally, you can use
**proj** for oblique projections to determine the corresponding rectangular **region** setting that will
give a subregion that fully covers the oblique domain.  **Note**: If the input grid is actually an image
(gray-scale, RGB, or RGBA), then options **extend** and **z_subregion** are unavailable, while for multi-layer
Geotiff files only options **region**, **circ_subregion** are supported, i.e., you can cut out a sub-region
only (which we do via *gdal_translate* if you have multiple bands).  Complementary to **grdcut** there is
\myreflink{grdpaste}, which will join together two grid files (not images) along a common edge.

Required Arguments
------------------

*ingrid* : -- A grid file name or a \myreflink{Grid type}

\textinput{common_opts/opt_-Grid}

\textinput{common_opts/opt_R}

Optional Arguments
------------------

- **D** or **dryrun** : -- *dryrun=true* **|** *dryrun="+t"*\
    A "dry run": Simply report the region and increment of what would be the
    extracted grid given the selected options. No grid is created (|-G| is disallowed)
    and instead we write a single data record with *west east south north xinc yinc*
    to standard output. The increments will reflect the input grid unless it is a
    remote gridded data set without implied resolution. Append **+t** to instead receive
    the information as the trailing string "-Rwest/east/south/north -Ixinc/yinc".

- **E** or **rowlice** or **colslice** : -- *rowlice=coord* **|** *colslice=coord*\
    We extract a vertical slice going along the x-column coord or along the y-row coord, depending on the
    given directive. Note:
        1- Input file must be a 3-D netCDF cube, and this option resturns a `GMTgrid`.
        2- `coord` must exactly match the coordinates given by the cube. We are not interpolating between
           nodes and only do a clean slice through existing cube nodes.
        3- If using the terse GMT syntax (**E**), then argument must be a string and prefixed with either
           a `x` (for extracting a slice along a column) or a `y`. Example: `E="x10.5"`

- **F** or **clip** or **cutline** : -- *cutline=polyg* **|** *cutline=(polygon=polyg, crop2cutline=true, invert=true)*\
    Specify a multisegment closed polygon file. All grid nodes outside the polygon will be set to NaN.
    Use the NamedTuple way to say `invert=true` to invert that and set all nodes inside the polygon to NaN
    instead. Optionally, add `crop2cutline=true` to crop the grid region to reflect the bounding box of the polygon.

\textinput{common_opts/opt_J}

- **N** or **extend** : -- *extend=true* **|** *extend=nodata*\
    Allow grid to be extended if new **region** exceeds existing boundaries.
    Append *nodata* value to initialize nodes outside current region [Default is NaN].

- **S** or **circ_subregion** : -- *circ_subregion=(lon,lat,radius)* **|** *circ_subregion="lon/lat/radius+n"*\
    Specify an origin and radius; append a distance unit and we determine the corresponding rectangular
    region so that all grid nodes on or inside the circle are contained in the subset. If **+n** is appended
    (and hence all arg must be a string) we set all nodes outside the circle to NaN.

\textinput{common_opts/opt_V}

- **Z** or **range** : -- *z_subregion=true* **|** *range=(min,max)* **|** *range="min/max|+n|N|r"*\
    Determine a new rectangular region so that all nodes *outside* this region are also outside the given
    *z*-range [-inf/+inf]. To indicate no limit on min or max only, specify a hyphen (-) (and hence all
    arg must be a string). Normally, any NaNs encountered are simply skipped and not considered in the
    range-decision. Append **+n** (arg must be a string too) to consider a NaN to be outside the given
    *z*-range. This means the new subset will be NaN-free. Alternatively, append **+r** to consider NaNs
    to be within the data range. In this case we stop shrinking the boundaries once a NaN is found
    [Default simply skips NaNs when making the range decision]. Finally, if your core subset grid is
    surrounded by rows and/or columns that are all NaNs, append **+N** to strip off such columns before
    (optionally) considering the range of the core subset for further reduction of the area.

Examples
--------

To obtain data for an oblique Mercator projection map we need to extract more data that is actually used.
This is necessary because the output of **grdcut** has edges defined by parallels and meridians, while
the oblique map in general does not. Hence, to get all the data from the ETOPO2 data needed to make a
contour map for the region defined by its lower left and upper right corners and the desired projection, use:

```julia
    G = grdcut("@earth_relief_02m", region_diag=(160,20,220,30), proj="oc190/25.5/292/69/1");
```

Suppose you have used \myreflink{surface} to grid ship gravity in the region
between 148E - 162E and 8N - 32N, and you do not trust the gridding near
the edges, so you want to keep only the area between 150E - 160E and 10N - 30N, then:

```julia
    G = grdcut("grav_148_162_8_32.nc", region=(150,160,10,30));
```

To return the subregion of a grid such that any boundary strips where
all values are entirely above 0 are excluded, try::

```julia
    G = grdcut("bathy.nc", z_subregion="-/0");
```

To return the subregion of a grid such that any boundary rows or columns that are all NaNs, try:

```julia
    G = grdcut("bathy.nc", z_subregion="+N");
```

To return the subregion of a grid that contains all nodes within a
distance of 500 km from the point 45,30 try:

```julia
    G = grdcutgrdcut("bathy.nc", circ_subregion="45/30/500k");
```

To create a topography grid with data only inside France and set it
to NaN outside France, based on the 10x10 minute DEM, try:

\begin{examplefig}{}
```julia
using GMT
D = coast(DCW=:FR, dump=true);
G = grdcut("@earth_relief_10m", cutline=(polygon=D, crop2cutline=true));
imshow(G)
```
\end{examplefig}

To determine what grid region and resolution (in text format) most suitable for a 24 cm wide map
that is using an oblique projection to display the remote Earth Relief data grid, try:

```julia
    grdcut("@earth_relief", region_diag=(270,20,305,25), proj="Oc280/25.5/22/69/24c", dryrun="+t")
```

Notes
-----

If the input file is a geotiff with multiple data bands then the output format will
depend on your selection (if any) of the bands to keep: If you do not specify
any bands (which means we consider all the available bands) or you select more
than one band, then the output file can either be another geotiff (if you give
a .tif[f] extension) or it can be a multiband netCDF file (if you give a .nc or .grd
extension). If you select a single band from the input geotiff then GMT will
normally read that in as a single grid layer and thus write a netCDF grid (unless
you append another grid format specifier). However, if your output filename has
a .tif[f] extension then we will instead write it as a one-band geotiff.
All geotiff output operations are done via GDAL's *gdal_translate*.
