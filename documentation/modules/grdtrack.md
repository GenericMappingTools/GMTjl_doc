Sample grids at specified (x,y) locations

## WARNING: ONLY HALF PORTED TO GMT.JL NEED HELP FOR FINISHING

Description
-----------

Reads one or more grid files (or a Sandwell/Smith IMG files) and a table (from file or standard input; but see **profile** for
exception) with (x,y) [or (lon,lat)] positions in the first two columns
(more columns may be present). It interpolates the grid(s) at the
positions in the table and writes out the table with the interpolated
values added as (one or more) new columns. Alternatively (**crossprofile**), the
input is considered to be line-segments and we create orthogonal
cross-profiles at each data point or with an equidistant separation and
sample the grid(s) along these profiles. A bicubic [Default], bilinear,
B-spline or nearest-neighbor (see **interp**) interpolation is used,
requiring boundary conditions at the limits of the region (see **interp**;
Default uses "natural" conditions (second partial derivative normal to
edge is zero) unless the grid is automatically recognized as periodic.)

Required Arguments
------------------

- *table*\
    One or more data tables holding the (x,y) positions where the user wants to sample the 2-D data set.
    Mandatory except if **profile** option is used.

- **G** or **grid** : -- *grid=GMTgrid* **|** *grid=gridfile*\
    \myreflink{GMTgrid} (a grid type) or *gridfile* is a 2-D binary grid file with the function f(x,y).
    If the specified grid is in Sandwell/Smith Mercator format you must append
    a comma-separated list of arguments that includes a scale to
    multiply the data (usually 1 or 0.1), the mode which stand for the
    following: (0) Img files with no constraint code, returns data at
    all points, (1) Img file with constraints coded, return data at all
    points, (2) Img file with constraints coded, return data only at
    constrained points and NaN elsewhere, and (3) Img file
    with constraints coded, return 1 at constraints and 0 elsewhere, and
    optionally the max latitude in the IMG file [80.738]. You may repeat
    **grid** as many times as you have grids you wish to sample.
    Alternatively, use **-G+l**\ *list* to pass a file whose first word
    in the trailing text record will be extracted as the file names.
    The grids are sampled and results are output in the order given.
    **Note**: If *gridfile* is a remote global grid and no registration is specified then **grdtrack**
    will default to gridline registration (instead of the default pixel registration)
    to ensure all input points are inside the grid.

Optional Arguments
------------------

- **A** or **interp_path** or **resample** : -- *interp_path=*[**f|p|m|r|R**][**+l**]\
    For track resampling (if **crossprofile** or **profile** are set) we can select how this
    is to be performed. Append **f** to keep original points, but add intermediate points if
    needed [Default], **m** as **f**, but first follow meridian (along y) then parallel (along x),
    **p** as **f**, but first follow parallel (along y) then meridian (along x), **r** to resample
    at equidistant locations; input points are not necessarily included in the output, and **R**
    as **r**, but adjust given spacing to fit the track length exactly. Finally, append **+l**
    if geographic distances should be measured along rhumb lines (loxodromes) instead of great
    circles. Ignored unless **crossprofile** is used.

- **C** or **crossprofile** : -- *crossprofile=*length/ds*[*/spacing*][**+a|v**][**d|f** *value*][**l|r**]\
    Use input line segments to create an equidistant and (optionally) equally-spaced set of
    crossing profiles along which we sample the grid(s) [Default simply samples the grid(s)
    at the input locations]. Specify two length scales that control how the sampling is done:
    *length* sets the full length of each cross-profile, while *ds* is the sampling spacing along
    each cross-profile. Optionally, append **/** *spacing* for an equidistant spacing between
    cross-profiles [Default erects cross-profiles at the input coordinates]; see **interp_path**
    for how resampling the input track is controlled. By default, all cross-profiles have the same
    direction (left to right as we look in the direction of the input line segment). Append **+a**
    to alternate the direction of cross-profiles, or **v** to enforce either a "west-to-east" or
    "south-to-north" view. By default the entire profiles are output.  Choose to only output the
    left or right halves of the profiles by appending **+l** or **+r**, respectively.  Append
    suitable units to *length*; it sets the unit used for *ds* (and *spacing*) (See `Units` below).
    The default unit for geographic grids is meter while Cartesian grids implies the user unit.
    The output columns will be *lon*, *lat*, *dist*, *azimuth*, *z1*, *z2*, ..., *zn* (The *zi* are
    the sampled values for each of the *n* grids). Use **+d** to change the profiles from being
    orthogonal to the line by the given *deviation* [0]. Looking in the direction of the line, a
    positive *deviation* will rotate the crosslines clockwise and a negative one will rotate them
    counter-clockwise. Finally, you can use **+f** to set a fixed azimuth for all profiles.

- **D** or **dfile** : -- *dfile=fname*\
    In concert with **crossprofile** we can save the (possibly resampled) original lines to the
    file *fname* [Default only saves/returns the cross-profiles]. The columns will be
    *lon*, *lat*, *dist*, *azimuth*, *z1*, *z2*, ...  (sampled value for each grid)

- **E** or **profile** : -- *profile=*line*\ [,\ *line*,...][**+a**\ *az*][**+c**][**+d**][**+g**][**+i**\ *inc*][**+l**\ *length*][**+n**\ *np*][**+o**\ *az*][**+r**\ *radius*]*\
    Instead of reading input track coordinates, specify profiles via coordinates and modifiers.
    The format of each *line* is *start*/*stop*, where *start* or *stop* are either *lon*/*lat*
    (*x*/*y* for Cartesian data) or a 2-character XY key that uses the \myreflink{text}-style
    justification format to specify a point on the map as [LCR][BMT]. Each line will be a separate
    segment unless **+c** is used which will connect segments with shared joints into a single segment.
    In addition to line coordinates, you can use Z-, Z+ to mean the global minimum and maximum locations
    in the grid (only available if a single grid is given via **grid**). You may append **+i**\ *inc*
    to set the sampling interval; if not given then we default to half the minimum grid interval.
    For a *line* along parallels or meridians you can add **+g** to report degrees of longitude or
    latitude instead of great circle distances starting at zero. Instead of two coordinates you can
    specify an origin and one of **+a**, **+o**, or **+r**. The **+a** sets the azimuth of a profile
    of given length starting at the given origin, while **+o** centers the profile on the origin;
    both require **+l**. For circular sampling specify **+r** to define a circle of given radius
    centered on the origin; this option requires either **+n** or **+i**. The **+n**\ *np* modifier
    sets the desired number of points, while **+l**\ *length* gives the total length of the profile.
    Append **+d** to output the along-track distances after the coordinates. **Note**: No track file
    will be read. Also note that only one distance unit can be chosen.  Giving different units will
    result in an error. If no units are specified we default to great circle distances in km
    (if geographic). If working with geographic data you can use **-j** to control distance
    calculation mode [Great Circle]. **Note**: If **crossprofile** is set and *spacing* is given
    the that sampling scheme overrules any modifier set in **profile**.

- **F** or **critical** : -- *critical=[**+b**][**+n**][**+r**][**+z**\ *z0*]*\
    Find critical points along each cross-profile as a function of along-track distance.
    Requires **crossprofile** and a single input grid (*z*). We examine each cross-profile generated
    and report (*dist*, *lonc*, *latc*, *distc*, *azimuthc*, *zc*) at the center peak of
    maximum *z* value, (*lonl*, *latl*, *distl*) and (*lonr*, *latr*, *distr*)
    at the first and last non-NaN point whose *z*-value exceeds *z0*, respectively,
    and the *width* based on the two extreme points found. Here, *dist* is the distance
    along the original input *trackfile* and the other 12 output columns are a function
    of that distance.  When searching for the center peak and the extreme first and last
    values that exceed the threshold we assume the profile is positive up.  If we instead
    are looking for a trough then you must use **+n** to temporarily flip the profile to
    positive. The threshold *z0* value is always given as >= 0; use **+z** to change it [0].
    Alternatively, use **+b** to determine the balance point and standard deviation of the
    profile; this is the weighted mean and weighted standard deviation of the distances,
    with *z* acting as the weight. Finally, use **+r** to obtain the weighted rms about the
    cross-track center (*distc* == 0). **Note**: We round the exact results to the nearest
    distance nodes along the cross-profiles. We write 13 output columns per track:
    *dist, lonc, latc, distc, azimuthc, zc, lonl, latl, distl, lonr, latr, distr, width*.

- **N** or **no_skip** or **noskip** : -- *no_skip=true*\
    Do *not* skip points that fall outside the domain of the grid(s) [Default only output points within grid domain].

\textinput{common_opts/opt_R}

- **S** or **stack** : -- *stack=method/modifiers*\
    In conjunction with **crossprofile**, compute a single stacked profile from
    all profiles across each segment. Append how stacking should be
    computed: **a** = mean (average), **m** = median, **p** = mode
    (maximum likelihood), **l** = lower, **L** = lower but only consider
    positive values, **u** = upper, **U** = upper but only consider
    negative values [**a**]. The *modifiers* control the output;
    choose one or more among these choices: **+a** : Append stacked
    values to all cross-profiles. **+d** : Append stack deviations to
    all cross-profiles. **+r** : Append data residuals (data - stack) to
    all cross-profiles. **+s**\ [*file*] : Save stacked profile to
    *file* [grdtrack_stacked_profile.txt]. **+c**\ *fact* : Compute
    envelope on stacked profile as ±\ *fact* \*\ *deviation* [2].
    Notes: (1) Deviations depend on *method* and are st.dev (**a**), L1
    scale, i.e., 1.4826 \* median absolute deviation (MAD) (for **m** and **p**), or half-range (upper-lower)/2. (2) The
    stacked profile file contains a leading column plus groups of 4-6 columns, with one
    group for each sampled grid. The leading column holds cross distance,
    while the first four columns in a group hold stacked value, deviation, min
    value, and max value, respectively. If *method* is one of
    **a**\|\ **m**\|\ **p** then we also write the lower and upper
    confidence bounds (see **+c**). When one or more of **+a**, **+d**,
    and **+r** are used then we also append the stacking results to the end of each
    row, for all cross-profiles. The order is always stacked value
    (**+a**), followed by deviations (**+d**) and finally residuals (**+r**).
    When more than one grid is sampled this sequence of 1-3 columns is
    repeated for each grid.

- **T** or **radius** : -- *radius= [*radius*][**+e|p**]*\
   To be used with normal grid sampling, and limited to a single, non-IMG grid. If the nearest
   node to the input point is NaN, search outwards until we find the nearest non-NaN node and
   report that value instead. Optionally specify a search radius which limits the consideration
   to points within this distance from the input point. To report the location of the nearest
   node and its distance from the input point, append **+e**. The default unit for geographic
   grid distances is spherical degrees. Use *radius* to change the unit and give *radius* = 0
   if you do not want to limit the radius search.  To instead replace the input point with the
   coordinates of the nearest node, append **+p**.

\textinput{common_opts/opt_V}

- **Z** or **z_only** : -- *z_only=true*\
    Only write out the sampled z-values [Default writes all columns].
    **Note**: If used in conjunction with **-s** then the default
    column becomes 0 instead of 2. If specifying specific columns
    in **-s** then start numbering the z-columns from 0 instead of 2.

Hints
-----

If an interpolation point is not on a node of the input grid, then a NaN at any node in the
neighborhood surrounding the point will yield an interpolated NaN. Bicubic interpolation [default]
yields continuous first derivatives but requires a neighborhood of 4 nodes by 4 nodes. Bilinear
interpolation [**interp**] uses only a 2 by 2 neighborhood, but yields only zeroth-order continuity.
Use bicubic when smoothness is important. Use bilinear to minimize the propagation of NaNs, or lower *threshold*.

Examples
--------

To extract a profile along a great circle between (0,0) to (20,20) from the remote grid earth_relief_05m,
and only write out (dist, topo) records, try

\begin{examplefig}{}
```julia
using GMT
resetGMT()  # hide
D = grdtrack("@earth_relief_05m", region=(0,20,0,20), profile="BL/TR+d", o="3,2")
imshow(D)
```
\end{examplefig}

To sample the file hawaii_topo.nc along the SEASAT track track_4.xyg (An ASCII table containing longitude,
latitude, and SEASAT-derived gravity, preceded by one header record)

```julia
    D = grdtrack("track_4.xyg", grid="hawaii_topo.nc", header=1)
```

To sample the Sandwell/Smith IMG format file grav.18.1.img (1 minute
free-air anomalies on a Mercator grid) along 100-km-long cross-profiles
that are orthogonal to the line segment given in the file track.xy,
erecting cross-profiles every 25 km and sampling the grid every 3 km, try

```julia
    grdtrack("track.xy", grid="grav.18.1.img,0.1,1", crossprofile=("100k",3,25), interp_path=:r)
```

The same thing, but now determining the central anomaly location along track,
with a threshold of 25 mGal, try

```julia
    grdtrack("track.xy", grid="grav.18.1.img,0.1,1", crossprofile=("100k",3,25), critical="+z25")
```

To sample the grid data.nc along a line from the lower left to the upper right corner,
using a grid spacing of 1 km on the geodesic, and output distances as well, try

```julia
    grdtrack(profile="LB/RT+i1k+d", grid="data.nc", spherical=:ellipsoidal)
```
