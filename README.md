# GMTjl_doc

This repository hosts the manual of the [GMT.jl](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/GMT.jl) package.
I would like to acknowlege the help provided by [Thibaut Lienart](https://github.com/tlienart) in the
early stages of setting this site (and make it run) as well as the creators of the
[Makie](https://makie.juliaplots.org/) manual that was used as base to create this one.

The following two badges link the same manual hosted in 2 different places. Fist link is more
complete as the Windows (local) build shows rather less error then the Unix (CI) build. 

| **Documentation (Win build)**            | **Documentation (Unix build)**   |
